1 Introduction
**************

AVRDUDE - AVR Downloader Uploader - is a program for downloading and
uploading the on-chip memories of Atmel's AVR microcontrollers. It can
program the Flash and EEPROM, and where supported by the serial
programming protocol, it can program fuse and lock bits. AVRDUDE also
supplies a direct instruction mode allowing one to issue any programming
instruction to the AVR chip regardless of whether AVRDUDE implements
that specific feature of a particular chip.

   AVRDUDE can be used effectively via the command line to read or write
all chip memory types (eeprom, flash, fuse bits, lock bits, signature
bytes) or via an interactive (terminal) mode. Using AVRDUDE from the
command line works well for programming the entire memory of the chip
from the contents of a file, while interactive mode is useful for
exploring memory contents, modifying individual bytes of eeprom,
programming fuse/lock bits, etc.

   AVRDUDE supports the following basic programmer types: Atmel's
STK500, Atmel's AVRISP and AVRISP mkII devices, Atmel's STK600, Atmel's
JTAG ICE (the original one, mkII, and 3, the latter two also in ISP
mode), appnote avr910, appnote avr109 (including the AVR Butterfly),
serial bit-bang adapters, and the PPI (parallel port interface). PPI
represents a class of simple programmers where the programming lines
are directly connected to the PC parallel port. Several pin
configurations exist for several variations of the PPI programmers, and
AVRDUDE can be configured to work with them by either specifying the
appropriate programmer on the command line or by creating a new entry
in its configuration file. All that's usually required for a new entry
is to tell AVRDUDE which pins to use for each programming function.

   A number of equally simple bit-bang programming adapters that connect
to a serial port are supported as well, among them the popular Ponyprog
serial adapter, and the DASA and DASA3 adapters that used to be
supported by uisp(1).  Note that these adapters are meant to be
attached to a physical serial port.  Connecting to a serial port
emulated on top of USB is likely to not work at all, or to work
abysmally slow.

   If you happen to have a Linux system with at least 4 hardware GPIOs
available (like almost all embedded Linux boards) you can do without
any additional hardware - just connect them to the MOSI, MISO, RESET
and SCK pins on the AVR and use the linuxgpio programmer type. It
bitbangs the lines using the Linux sysfs GPIO interface. Of course,
care should be taken about voltage level compatibility. Also, although
not strictly required, it is strongly advisable to protect the GPIO
pins from overcurrent situations in some way. The simplest would be to
just put some resistors in series or better yet use a 3-state buffer
driver like the 74HC244. Have a look at
http://kolev.info/avrdude-linuxgpio for a more detailed tutorial about
using this programmer type.

   The STK500, JTAG ICE, avr910, and avr109/butterfly use the serial
port to communicate with the PC.  The STK600, JTAG ICE mkII/3, AVRISP
mkII, USBasp, avrftdi (and derivatives), and USBtinyISP programmers
communicate through the USB, using `libusb' as a platform abstraction
layer.  The avrftdi adds support for the FT2232C/D, FT2232H, and
FT4232H devices. These all use the MPSSE mode, which has a specific pin
mapping. Bit 1 (the lsb of the byte in the config file) is SCK. Bit 2
is MOSI, and Bit 3 is MISO. Bit 4 usually reset. The 2232C/D parts are
only supported on interface A, but the H parts can be either A or B
(specified by the usbdev config parameter).  The STK500, STK600, JTAG
ICE, and avr910 contain on-board logic to control the programming of
the target device.  The avr109 bootloader implements a protocol similar
to avr910, but is actually implemented in the boot area of the target's
flash ROM, as opposed to being an external device.  The fundamental
difference between the two types lies in the protocol used to control
the programmer. The avr910 protocol is very simplistic and can easily
be used as the basis for a simple, home made programmer since the
firmware is available online. On the other hand, the STK500 protocol is
more robust and complicated and the firmware is not openly available.
The JTAG ICE also uses a serial communication protocol which is similar
to the STK500 firmware version 2 one.  However, as the JTAG ICE is
intended to allow on-chip debugging as well as memory programming, the
protocol is more sophisticated.  (The JTAG ICE mkII protocol can also
be run on top of USB.)  Only the memory programming functionality of
the JTAG ICE is supported by AVRDUDE.  For the JTAG ICE mkII/3, JTAG,
debugWire and ISP mode are supported, provided it has a firmware
revision of at least 4.14 (decimal).  See below for the limitations of
debugWire.  For ATxmega devices, the JTAG ICE mkII/3 is supported in
PDI mode, provided it has a revision 1 hardware and firmware version of
at least 5.37 (decimal).

   The Atmel-ICE (ARM/AVR) is supported (JTAG, PDI for Xmega,
debugWIRE, ISP modes).

   Atmel's XplainedPro boards, using EDBG protocol (CMSIS-DAP
compliant), are supported by the "jtag3" programmer type.

   Atmel's XplainedMini boards, using mEDBG protocol, are also
supported by the "jtag3" programmer type.

   The AVR Dragon is supported in all modes (ISP, JTAG, PDI, HVSP, PP,
debugWire).  When used in JTAG and debugWire mode, the AVR Dragon
behaves similar to a JTAG ICE mkII, so all device-specific comments for
that device will apply as well.  When used in ISP and PDI mode, the AVR
Dragon behaves similar to an AVRISP mkII (or JTAG ICE mkII in ISP
mode), so all device-specific comments will apply there.  In
particular, the Dragon starts out with a rather fast ISP clock
frequency, so the `-B BITCLOCK' option might be required to achieve a
stable ISP communication.  For ATxmega devices, the AVR Dragon is
supported in PDI mode, provided it has a firmware version of at least
6.11 (decimal).

   Wiring boards are supported, utilizing STK500 V2.x protocol, but a
simple DTR/RTS toggle to set the boards into programming mode.  The
programmer type is "wiring".

   The Arduino (which is very similar to the STK500 1.x) is supported
via its own programmer type specification "arduino".

   The BusPirate is a versatile tool that can also be used as an AVR
programmer.  A single BusPirate can be connected to up to 3 independent
AVRs. See the section on _extended parameters_ below for details.

   The USBasp ISP and USBtinyISP adapters are also supported, provided
AVRDUDE has been compiled with libusb support.  They both feature
simple firmware-only USB implementations, running on an ATmega8 (or
ATmega88), or ATtiny2313, respectively.

   The Atmel DFU bootloader is supported in both, FLIP protocol version
1 (AT90USB* and ATmega*U* devices), as well as version 2 (Xmega
devices).  See below for some hints about FLIP version 1 protocol
behaviour.

1.1 History and Credits
=======================

AVRDUDE was written by Brian S. Dean under the name of AVRPROG to run on
the FreeBSD Operating System.  Brian renamed the software to be called
AVRDUDE when interest grew in a Windows port of the software so that the
name did not conflict with AVRPROG.EXE which is the name of Atmel's
Windows programming software.

   The AVRDUDE source now resides in the public CVS repository on
savannah.gnu.org (`http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/avrdude/'), where
it continues to be enhanced and ported to other systems.  In addition
to FreeBSD, AVRDUDE now runs on Linux and Windows.  The developers
behind the porting effort primarily were Ted Roth, Eric Weddington, and
Joerg Wunsch.

   And in the spirit of many open source projects, this manual also
draws on the work of others.  The initial revision was composed of
parts of the original Unix manual page written by Joerg Wunsch, the
original web site documentation by Brian Dean, and from the comments
describing the fields in the AVRDUDE configuration file by Brian Dean.
The texi formatting was modeled after that of the Simulavr
documentation by Ted Roth.

2.1 Option Descriptions
=======================

AVRDUDE is a command line tool, used as follows:

     avrdude -p partno OPTIONS ...

Command line options are used to control AVRDUDE's behaviour.  The
following options are recognized:

`-p PARTNO'
     This is the only mandatory option and it tells AVRDUDE what type
     of part (MCU) that is connected to the programmer.  The PARTNO
     parameter is the part's id listed in the configuration file.
     Specify -p ? to list all parts in the configuration file.  If a
     part is unknown to AVRDUDE, it means that there is no config file
     entry for that part, but it can be added to the configuration file
     if you have the Atmel datasheet so that you can enter the
     programming specifications.  Currently, the following MCU types

     (*)   The AT90S2323 and ATtiny22 use the same algorithm.

     (**)  Flash addressing above 128 KB is not supported by all
     programming hardware.  Known to work are jtag2, stk500v2, and
     bit-bang programmers.

     (***) The ATtiny11 can only be programmed in high-voltage serial
     mode.

     (****) The ISP programming protocol of the AT90S1200 differs in
     subtle ways from that of other AVRs.  Thus, not all programmers
     support this device.  Known to work are all direct bitbang
     programmers, and all programmers talking the STK500v2 protocol.

`-b BAUDRATE'
     Override the RS-232 connection baud rate specified in the
     respective programmer's entry of the configuration file.

`-B BITCLOCK'
     Specify the bit clock period for the JTAG interface or the ISP
     clock (JTAG ICE only).  The value is a floating-point number in
     microseconds.  Alternatively, the value might be suffixed with
     "Hz", "kHz", or "MHz", in order to specify the bit clock
     frequency, rather than a period.  The default value of the JTAG
     ICE results in about 1 microsecond bit clock period, suitable for
     target MCUs running at 4 MHz clock and above.  Unlike certain
     parameters in the STK500, the JTAG ICE resets all its parameters
     to default values when the programming software signs off from the
     ICE, so for MCUs running at lower clock speeds, this parameter
     must be specified on the command-line.  It can also be set in the
     configuration file by using the 'default_bitclock' keyword.

`-c PROGRAMMER-ID'
     Specify the programmer to be used.  AVRDUDE knows about several
     common programmers.  Use this option to specify which one to use.
     The PROGRAMMER-ID parameter is the programmer's id listed in the
     configuration file.  Specify -c ? to list all programmers in the
     configuration file.  If you have a programmer that is unknown to
     AVRDUDE, and the programmer is controlled via the PC parallel port,
     there's a good chance that it can be easily added to the
     configuration file without any code changes to AVRDUDE.  Simply
     copy an existing entry and change the pin definitions to match
     that of the unknown programmer.  Currently, the following
     programmer ids are understood and supported:



`-C CONFIG-FILE'
     Use the specified config file for configuration data.  This file
     contains all programmer and part definitions that AVRDUDE knows
     about.  If not specified, AVRDUDE reads the configuration file from
     /usr/local/etc/avrdude.conf (FreeBSD and Linux). See Appendix A for
     the method of searching for the configuration file for Windows.

     If CONFIG-FILE is written as +FILENAME then this file is read
     after the system wide and user configuration files. This can be
     used to add entries to the configuration without patching your
     system wide configuration file. It can be used several times, the
     files are read in same order as given on the command line.

`-D'
     Disable auto erase for flash.  When the -U option with flash
     memory is specified, avrdude will perform a chip erase before
     starting any of the programming operations, since it generally is
     a mistake to program the flash without performing an erase first.
     This option disables that.  Auto erase is not used for ATxmega
     devices as these devices can use page erase before writing each
     page so no explicit chip erase is required.  Note however that any
     page not affected by the current operation will retain its
     previous contents.

`-e'
     Causes a chip erase to be executed.  This will reset the contents
     of the flash ROM and EEPROM to the value `0xff', and clear all
     lock bits.  Except for ATxmega devices which can use page erase,
     it is basically a prerequisite command before the flash ROM can be
     reprogrammed again.  The only exception would be if the new
     contents would exclusively cause bits to be programmed from the
     value `1' to `0'.  Note that in order to reprogram EERPOM cells,
     no explicit prior chip erase is required since the MCU provides an
     auto-erase cycle in that case before programming the cell.

`-E EXITSPEC[,...]'
     By default, AVRDUDE leaves the parallel port in the same state at
     exit as it has been found at startup.  This option modifies the
     state of the `/RESET' and `Vcc' lines the parallel port is left
     at, according to the exitspec arguments provided, as follows:

    `reset'
          The `/RESET' signal will be left activated at program exit,
          that is it will be held low, in order to keep the MCU in
          reset state afterwards.  Note in particular that the
          programming algorithm for the AT90S1200 device mandates that
          the `/RESET' signal is active before powering up the MCU, so
          in case an external power supply is used for this MCU type, a
          previous invocation of AVRDUDE with this option specified is
          one of the possible ways to guarantee this condition.

    `noreset'
          The `/RESET' line will be deactivated at program exit, thus
          allowing the MCU target program to run while the programming
          hardware remains connected.

    `vcc'
          This option will leave those parallel port pins active (i. e.
          high) that can be used to supply `Vcc' power to the MCU.

    `novcc'
          This option will pull the `Vcc' pins of the parallel port
          down at program exit.

    `d_high'
          This option will leave the 8 data pins on the parallel port
          active (i. e. high).

    `d_low'
          This option will leave the 8 data pins on the parallel port
          inactive (i. e. low).


     Multiple EXITSPEC arguments can be separated with commas.

`-F'
     Normally, AVRDUDE tries to verify that the device signature read
     from the part is reasonable before continuing.  Since it can
     happen from time to time that a device has a broken (erased or
     overwritten) device signature but is otherwise operating normally,
     this options is provided to override the check.  Also, for
     programmers like the Atmel STK500 and STK600 which can adjust
     parameters local to the programming tool (independent of an actual
     connection to a target controller), this option can be used
     together with `-t' to continue in terminal mode.

`-i DELAY'
     For bitbang-type programmers, delay for approximately DELAY
     microseconds between each bit state change.  If the host system is
     very fast, or the target runs off a slow clock (like a 32 kHz
     crystal, or the 128 kHz internal RC oscillator), this can become
     necessary to satisfy the requirement that the ISP clock frequency
     must not be higher than 1/4 of the CPU clock frequency.  This is
     implemented as a spin-loop delay to allow even for very short
     delays.  On Unix-style operating systems, the spin loop is
     initially calibrated against a system timer, so the number of
     microseconds might be rather realistic, assuming a constant system
     load while AVRDUDE is running.  On Win32 operating systems, a
     preconfigured number of cycles per microsecond is assumed that
     might be off a bit for very fast or very slow machines.

`-l LOGFILE'
     Use LOGFILE rather than STDERR for diagnostics output.  Note that
     initial diagnostic messages (during option parsing) are still
     written to STDERR anyway.

`-n'
     No-write - disables actually writing data to the MCU (useful for
     debugging AVRDUDE).

`-O'
     Perform a RC oscillator run-time calibration according to Atmel
     application note AVR053.  This is only supported on the STK500v2,
     AVRISP mkII, and JTAG ICE mkII hardware.  Note that the result
     will be stored in the EEPROM cell at address 0.

`-P PORT'
     Use port to identify the device to which the programmer is
     attached.  Normally, the default parallel port is used, but if the
     programmer type normally connects to the serial port, the default
     serial port will be used. See Appendix A, Platform Dependent
     Information, to find out the default port names for your platform.
     If you need to use a different parallel or serial port, use this
     option to specify the alternate port name.

     On Win32 operating systems, the parallel ports are referred to as
     lpt1 through lpt3, referring to the addresses 0x378, 0x278, and
     0x3BC, respectively.  If the parallel port can be accessed through
     a different address, this address can be specified directly, using
     the common C language notation (i. e., hexadecimal values are
     prefixed by 0X).

     For the JTAG ICE mkII, if AVRDUDE has been built with libusb
     support, PORT may alternatively be specified as `usb'[:SERIALNO].
     In that case, the JTAG ICE mkII will be looked up on USB.  If
     SERIALNO is also specified, it will be matched against the serial
     number read from any JTAG ICE mkII found on USB.  The match is
     done after stripping any existing colons from the given serial
     number, and right-to-left, so only the least significant bytes
     from the serial number need to be given.  For a trick how to find
     out the serial numbers of all JTAG ICEs attached to USB, see *Note
     Example Command Line Invocations::.

     As the AVRISP mkII device can only be talked to over USB, the very
     same method of specifying the port is required there.

     For the USB programmer "AVR-Doper" running in HID mode, the port
     must be specified as AVRDOPER. Libusb support is required on Unix
     but not on Windows. For more information about AVR-Doper see
     `http://www.obdev.at/avrusb/avrdoper.html'.

     For the USBtinyISP, which is a simplistic device not implementing
     serial numbers, multiple devices can be distinguished by their
     location in the USB hierarchy.  *Note Troubleshooting::, for
     examples.

     For programmers that attach to a serial port using some kind of
     higher level protocol (as opposed to bit-bang style programmers),
     PORT can be specified as `net':HOST:PORT.  In this case, instead
     of trying to open a local device, a TCP network connection to
     (TCP) PORT on HOST is established.  The remote endpoint is assumed
     to be a terminal or console server that connects the network
     stream to a local serial port where the actual programmer has been
     attached to.  The port is assumed to be properly configured, for
     example using a transparent 8-bit data connection without parity
     at 115200 Baud for a STK500.

`-q'
     Disable (or quell) output of the progress bar while reading or
     writing to the device.  Specify it a second time for even quieter
     operation.

`-u'
     Disables the default behaviour of reading out the fuses three
     times before programming, then verifying at the end of programming
     that the fuses have not changed. If you want to change fuses you
     will need to specify this option, as avrdude will see the fuses
     have changed (even though you wanted to) and will change them back
     for your "safety". This option was designed to prevent cases of
     fuse bits magically changing (usually called _safemode_).

     If one of the configuration files contains a line

     `default_safemode = no;'

     safemode is disabled by default.  The `-u' option's effect is
     negated in that case, i. e. it _enables_ safemode.

     Safemode is always disabled for AVR32, Xmega and TPI devices.

`-s'
     Disable safemode prompting.  When safemode discovers that one or
     more fuse bits have unintentionally changed, it will prompt for
     confirmation regarding whether or not it should attempt to recover
     the fuse bit(s).  Specifying this flag disables the prompt and
     assumes that the fuse bit(s) should be recovered without asking for
     confirmation first.

`-t'
     Tells AVRDUDE to enter the interactive "terminal" mode instead of
     up- or downloading files.  See below for a detailed description of
     the terminal mode.

`-U MEMTYPE:OP:FILENAME[:FORMAT]'
     Perform a memory operation.  Multiple `-U' options can be
     specified in order to operate on multiple memories on the same
     command-line invocation.  The MEMTYPE field specifies the memory
     type to operate on. Use the `-v' option on the command line or the
     `part' command from terminal mode to display all the memory types
     supported by a particular device.  Typically, a device's memory
     configuration at least contains the memory types `flash' and
     `eeprom'.  All memory types currently known are:
    `calibration'
          One or more bytes of RC oscillator calibration data.

    `eeprom'
          The EEPROM of the device.

    `efuse'
          The extended fuse byte.

    `flash'
          The flash ROM of the device.

    `fuse'
          The fuse byte in devices that have only a single fuse byte.

    `hfuse'
          The high fuse byte.

    `lfuse'
          The low fuse byte.

    `lock'
          The lock byte.

    `signature'
          The three device signature bytes (device ID).

    `fuse_N_'
          The fuse bytes of ATxmega devices, _N_ is an integer number
          for each fuse supported by the device.

    `application'
          The application flash area of ATxmega devices.

    `apptable'
          The application table flash area of ATxmega devices.

    `boot'
          The boot flash area of ATxmega devices.

    `prodsig'
          The production signature (calibration) area of ATxmega
          devices.

    `usersig'
          The user signature area of ATxmega devices.

     The OP field specifies what operation to perform:

    `r'
          read the specified device memory and write to the specified
          file

    `w'
          read the specified file and write it to the specified device
          memory

    `v'
          read the specified device memory and the specified file and
          perform a verify operation


     The FILENAME field indicates the name of the file to read or
     write.  The FORMAT field is optional and contains the format of
     the file to read or write.  Possible values are:

    `i'
          Intel Hex

    `s'
          Motorola S-record

    `r'
          raw binary; little-endian byte order, in the case of the
          flash ROM data

    `e'
          ELF (Executable and Linkable Format), the final output file
          from the linker; currently only accepted as an input file

    `m'
          immediate mode; actual byte values specified on the command
          line, separated by commas or spaces in place of the FILENAME
          field of the `-U' option.  This is useful for programming
          fuse bytes without having to create a single-byte file or
          enter terminal mode.  If the number specified begins with
          `0x', it is treated as a hex value.  If the number otherwise
          begins with a leading zero (`0') it is treated as octal.
          Otherwise, the value is treated as decimal.

    `a'
          auto detect; valid for input only, and only if the input is
          not provided at stdin.

    `d'
          decimal; this and the following formats are only valid on
          output.  They generate one line of output for the respective
          memory section, forming a comma-separated list of the values.
          This can be particularly useful for subsequent processing,
          like for fuse bit settings.

    `h'
          hexadecimal; each value will get the string _0x_ prepended.

    `o'
          octal; each value will get a _0_ prepended unless it is less
          than 8 in which case it gets no prefix.

    `b'
          binary; each value will get the string _0b_ prepended.


     The default is to use auto detection for input files, and raw
     binary format for output files.

     Note that if FILENAME contains a colon, the FORMAT field is no
     longer optional since the filename part following the colon would
     otherwise be misinterpreted as FORMAT.

     When reading any kind of flash memory area (including the various
     sub-areas in Xmega devices), the resulting output file will be
     truncated to not contain trailing 0xFF bytes which indicate
     unprogrammed (erased) memory.  Thus, if the entire memory is
     unprogrammed, this will result in an output file that has no
     contents at all.

     As an abbreviation, the form `-U' FILENAME is equivalent to
     specifying `-U' _flash:w:_FILENAME_:a_.  This will only work if
     FILENAME does not have a colon in it.

`-v'
     Enable verbose output.  More `-v' options increase verbosity level.

`-V'
     Disable automatic verify check when uploading data.

`-x EXTENDED_PARAM'
     Pass EXTENDED_PARAM to the chosen programmer implementation as an
     extended parameter.  The interpretation of the extended parameter
     depends on the programmer itself.  See below for a list of
     programmers accepting extended parameters.



File: avrdude.info,  Node: Programmers accepting extended parameters,  Next: Example Command Line Invocations,  Prev: Option Descriptions,  Up: Command Line Options

2.2 Programmers accepting extended parameters
=============================================

`JTAG ICE mkII/3'
`AVR Dragon'
     When using the JTAG ICE mkII/3 or AVR Dragon in JTAG mode, the
     following extended parameter is accepted:
    ``jtagchain=UB,UA,BB,BA''
          Setup the JTAG scan chain for UB units before, UA units
          after, BB bits before, and BA bits after the target AVR,
          respectively.  Each AVR unit within the chain shifts by 4
          bits.  Other JTAG units might require a different bit shift
          count.

`AVR910'
     The AVR910 programmer type accepts the following extended
     parameter:
    ``devcode=VALUE''
          Override the device code selection by using VALUE as the
          device code.  The programmer is not queried for the list of
          supported device codes, and the specified VALUE is not
          verified but used directly within the `T' command sent to the
          programmer.  VALUE can be specified using the conventional
          number notation of the C programming language.

    ``no_blockmode''
          Disables the default checking for block transfer capability.
          Use `no_blockmode' only if your `AVR910' programmer creates
          errors during initial sequence.

`BusPirate'
     The BusPirate programmer type accepts the following extended
     parameters:
    ``reset=cs,aux,aux2''
          The default setup assumes the BusPirate's CS output pin
          connected to the RESET pin on AVR side. It is however
          possible to have multiple AVRs connected to the same BP with
          MISO, MOSI and SCK lines common for all of them.  In such a
          case one AVR should have its RESET connected to BusPirate's
          _CS_ pin, second AVR's RESET connected to BusPirate's _AUX_
          pin and if your BusPirate has an _AUX2_ pin (only available
          on BusPirate version v1a with firmware 3.0 or newer) use that
          to activate RESET on the third AVR.

          It may be a good idea to decouple the BusPirate and the AVR's
          SPI buses from each other using a 3-state bus buffer. For
          example 74HC125 or 74HC244 are some good candidates with the
          latches driven by the appropriate reset pin (cs, aux or
          aux2). Otherwise the SPI traffic in one active circuit may
          interfere with programming the AVR in the other design.

    ``spifreq=0..7''
          `0' 30 kHz (default)
          `1' 125 kHz
          `2' 250 kHz
          `3' 1 MHz
          `4' 2 MHz
          `5' 2.6 MHz
          `6' 4 MHz
          `7' 8 MHz

    ``rawfreq=0..3''
          Sets the SPI speed and uses the Bus Pirate's binary
          "raw-wire" mode instead of the default binary SPI mode:

          `0' 5 kHz
          `1' 50 kHz
          `2' 100 kHz (Firmware
              v4.2+ only)
          `3' 400 kHz (v4.2+)

          The only advantage of the "raw-wire" mode is that different
          SPI frequencies are available. Paged writing is not
          implemented in this mode.

    ``ascii''
          Attempt to use ASCII mode even when the firmware supports
          BinMode (binary mode).  BinMode is supported in firmware 2.7
          and newer, older FW's either don't have BinMode or their
          BinMode is buggy. ASCII mode is slower and makes the above
          `reset=', `spifreq=' and `rawfreq=' parameters unavailable.
          Be aware that ASCII mode is not guaranteed to work with newer
          firmware versions, and is retained only to maintain
          compatibility with older firmware versions.

    ``nopagedwrite''
          Firmware versions 5.10 and newer support a binary mode SPI
          command that enables whole pages to be written to AVR flash
          memory at once, resulting in a significant write speed
          increase. If use of this mode is not desirable for some
          reason, this option disables it.

    ``nopagedread''
          Newer firmware versions support in binary mode SPI command
          some AVR Extended Commands. Using the "Bulk Memory Read from
          Flash" results in a significant read speed increase. If use
          of this mode is not desirable for some reason, this option
          disables it.

    ``cpufreq=125..4000''
          This sets the _AUX_  pin to output a frequency of N kHz.
          Connecting the _AUX_ pin to the XTAL1 pin of your MCU, you
          can provide it a clock, for example when it needs an external
          clock because of wrong fuses settings.  Make sure the CPU
          frequency is at least four times the SPI frequency.

    ``serial_recv_timeout=1...''
          This sets the serial receive timeout to the given value.  The
          timeout happens every time avrdude waits for the BusPirate
          prompt.  Especially in ascii mode this happens very often, so
          setting a smaller value can speed up programming a lot.  The
          default value is 100ms. Using 10ms might work in most cases.


`Wiring'
     When using the Wiring programmer type, the following optional
     extended parameter is accepted:
    ``snooze=0..32767''
          After performing the port open phase, AVRDUDE will
          wait/snooze for SNOOZE milliseconds before continuing to the
          protocol sync phase.  No toggling of DTR/RTS is performed if
          SNOOZE > 0.

`PICkit2'
     Connection to the PICkit2 programmer:
     `(AVR)'`(PICkit2)'
     `RST'`VPP/MCLR (1) '
     `VDD'`VDD Target (2) --
         possibly optional
         if AVR self powered
         '
     `GND'`GND (3) '
     `MISO'`PGD (4) '
     `SCLK'`PDC (5) '
     `OSI'`AUX (6) '

     Extended command line parameters:
    ``clockrate=RATE''
          Sets the SPI clocking rate in Hz (default is 100kHz).
          Alternately the -B or -i options can be used to set the
          period.

    ``timeout=USB-TRANSACTION-TIMEOUT''
          Sets the timeout for USB reads and writes in milliseconds
          (default is 1500 ms).

3 Terminal Mode Operation
*************************

AVRDUDE has an interactive mode called TERMINAL MODE that is enabled by
the `-t' option.  This mode allows one to enter interactive commands to
display and modify the various device memories, perform a chip erase,
display the device signature bytes and part parameters, and to send raw
programming commands.  Commands and parameters may be abbreviated to
their shortest unambiguous form.  Terminal mode also supports a command
history so that previously entered commands can be recalled and edited.

File: avrdude.info,  Node: Terminal Mode Commands,  Next: Terminal Mode Examples,  Prev: Terminal Mode Operation,  Up: Terminal Mode Operation

3.1 Terminal Mode Commands
==========================

The following commands are implemented:

`dump MEMTYPE ADDR NBYTES'
     Read NBYTES from the specified memory area, and display them in
     the usual hexadecimal and ASCII form.

`dump'
     Continue dumping the memory contents for another NBYTES where the
     previous dump command left off.

`write MEMTYPE ADDR BYTE1 ... BYTEN'
     Manually program the respective memory cells, starting at address
     addr, using the values BYTE1 through BYTEN.  This feature is not
     implemented for bank-addressed memories such as the flash memory of
     ATMega devices.

`erase'
     Perform a chip erase.

`send B1 B2 B3 B4'
     Send raw instruction codes to the AVR device.  If you need access
     to a feature of an AVR part that is not directly supported by
     AVRDUDE, this command allows you to use it, even though AVRDUDE
     does not implement the command.   When using direct SPI mode, up
     to 3 bytes can be omitted.

`sig'
     Display the device signature bytes.

`spi'
     Enter direct SPI mode.  The _pgmled_ pin acts as slave select.
     _Only supported on parallel bitbang programmers._

`part'
     Display the current part settings and parameters.  Includes chip
     specific information including all memory types supported by the
     device, read/write timing, etc.

`pgm'
     Return to programming mode (from direct SPI mode).

`verbose [LEVEL]'
     Change (when LEVEL is provided), or display the verbosity level.
     The initial verbosity level is controlled by the number of `-v'
     options given on the command line.

`?'
`help'
     Give a short on-line summary of the available commands.

`quit'
     Leave terminal mode and thus AVRDUDE.


In addition, the following commands are supported on the STK500 and
STK600 programmer:

`vtarg VOLTAGE'
     Set the target's supply voltage to VOLTAGE Volts.

`varef [CHANNEL] VOLTAGE'
     Set the adjustable voltage source to VOLTAGE Volts.  This voltage
     is normally used to drive the target's _Aref_ input on the STK500
     and STK600.  The STK600 offers two reference voltages, which can be
     selected by the optional parameter CHANNEL (either 0 or 1).

`fosc FREQ[`M'|`k']'
     Set the master oscillator to FREQ Hz.  An optional trailing letter
     `M' multiplies by 1E6, a trailing letter `k' by 1E3.

`fosc off'
     Turn the master oscillator off.

`sck PERIOD'
     _STK500 and STK600 only:_ Set the SCK clock period to PERIOD
     microseconds.

     _JTAG ICE only:_ Set the JTAG ICE bit clock period to PERIOD
     microseconds.  Note that unlike STK500 settings, this setting will
     be reverted to its default value (approximately 1 microsecond)
     when the programming software signs off from the JTAG ICE.  This
     parameter can also be used on the JTAG ICE mkII/3 to specify the
     ISP clock period when operating the ICE in ISP mode.

`parms'
     _STK500 and STK600 only:_ Display the current voltage and master
     oscillator parameters.

     _JTAG ICE only:_ Display the current target supply voltage and
     JTAG bit clock rate/period.

Program the fuse bits of an ATmega128 (disable M103 compatibility,
enable high speed external crystal, enable brown-out detection, slowly
rising power).  Note since we are working with fuse bits the -u (unsafe)
option is specified, which allows you to modify the fuse bits. First
display the factory defaults, then reprogram:

4 Configuration File
********************

AVRDUDE reads a configuration file upon startup which describes all of
the parts and programmers that it knows about.  The advantage of this is
that if you have a chip that is not currently supported by AVRDUDE, you
can add it to the configuration file without waiting for a new release
of AVRDUDE.  Likewise, if you have a parallel port programmer that is
not supported by AVRDUDE, chances are good that you can copy and
existing programmer definition, and with only a few changes, make your
programmer work with AVRDUDE.

   AVRDUDE first looks for a system wide configuration file in a
platform dependent location.  On Unix, this is usually
`/usr/local/etc/avrdude.conf', while on Windows it is usually in the
same location as the executable file.  The name of this file can be
changed using the `-C' command line option.  After the system wide
configuration file is parsed, AVRDUDE looks for a per-user configuration
file to augment or override the system wide defaults.  On Unix, the
per-user file is `.avrduderc' within the user's home directory.  On
Windows, this file is the `avrdude.rc' file located in the same
directory as the executable.

4.2 Programmer Definitions
==========================

The format of the programmer definition is as follows:

     programmer
         parent <id>                                 # <id> is a quoted string
         id       = <id1> [, <id2> [, <id3>] ...] ;  # <idN> are quoted strings
         desc     = <description> ;                  # quoted string
         type     = "par" | "stk500" | ... ;         # programmer type (see below for a list)
         baudrate = <num> ;                          # baudrate for serial ports
         vcc      = <num1> [, <num2> ... ] ;         # pin number(s)
         buff     = <num1> [, <num2> ... ] ;         # pin number(s)
         reset    = <num> ;                          # pin number
         sck      = <num> ;                          # pin number
         mosi     = <num> ;                          # pin number
         miso     = <num> ;                          # pin number
         errled   = <num> ;                          # pin number
         rdyled   = <num> ;                          # pin number
         pgmled   = <num> ;                          # pin number
         vfyled   = <num> ;                          # pin number
         usbvid   = <hexnum>;                        # USB VID (Vendor ID)
         usbpid   = <hexnum> [, <hexnum> ...];       # USB PID (Product ID)
         usbdev   = <interface>;                     # USB interface or other device info
         usbvendor = <vendorname>;                   # USB Vendor Name
         usbproduct = <productname>;                 # USB Product Name
         usbsn    = <serialno>;                      # USB Serial Number
       ;

If a parent is specified, all settings of it (except its ids) are used
for the new programmer. These values can be changed by new setting them
for the new programmer.

To invert a bit in the pin definitions, use `= ~ <num>'.

Not all programmer types can handle a list of USB PIDs.

Following programmer types are currently implemented:

4.3.1 Parent Part
-----------------

Parts can also inherit parameters from previously defined parts using
the following syntax. In this case specified integer and string values
override parameter values from the parent part. New memory definitions
are added to the definitions inherited from the parent.

        part parent <id>                              # quoted string
            id               = <id> ;                 # quoted string
            <any set of other parameters from the list above>
          ;

4.3.2 Instruction Format
------------------------

Instruction formats are specified as a comma separated list of string
values containing information (bit specifiers) about each of the 32 bits
of the instruction.  Bit specifiers may be one of the following formats:

`1'
     The bit is always set on input as well as output

`0'
     the bit is always clear on input as well as output

`x'
     the bit is ignored on input and output

`a'
     the bit is an address bit, the bit-number matches this bit
     specifier's position within the current instruction byte

`aN'
     the bit is the Nth address bit, bit-number = N, i.e., `a12' is
     address bit 12 on input, `a0' is address bit 0.

`i'
     the bit is an input data bit

`o'
     the bit is an output data bit


   Each instruction must be composed of 32 bit specifiers.  The
instruction specification closely follows the instruction data provided
in Atmel's data sheets for their parts.  For example, the EEPROM read
and write instruction for an AT90S2313 AVR part could be encoded as:


     read  = "1  0  1  0   0  0  0  0   x x x x  x x x x",
             "x a6 a5 a4  a3 a2 a1 a0   o o o o  o o o o";

     write = "1  1  0  0   0  0  0  0   x x x x  x x x x",
             "x a6 a5 a4  a3 a2 a1 a0   i i i i  i i i i";

4.4 Other Notes
===============

   * The `devicecode' parameter is the device code used by the STK500
     and is obtained from the software section (`avr061.zip') of
     Atmel's AVR061 application note available from
     `http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2525.pdf'.

   * Not all memory types will implement all instructions.

   * AVR Fuse bits and Lock bits are implemented as a type of memory.

   * Example memory types are: `flash', `eeprom', `fuse', `lfuse' (low
     fuse), `hfuse' (high fuse), `efuse' (extended fuse), `signature',
     `calibration', `lock'.

   * The memory type specified on the AVRDUDE command line must match
     one of the memory types defined for the specified chip.

   * The `pwroff_after_write' flag causes AVRDUDE to attempt to power
     the device off and back on after an unsuccessful write to the
     affected memory area if VCC programmer pins are defined.  If VCC
     pins are not defined for the programmer, a message indicating that
     the device needs a power-cycle is printed out.  This flag was
     added to work around a problem with the at90s4433/2333's; see the
     at90s4433 errata at:

     `http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc1280.pdf'

   * The boot loader from application note AVR109 (and thus also the AVR
     Butterfly) does not support writing of fuse bits.  Writing lock
     bits is supported, but is restricted to the boot lock bits
     (BLBxx).  These are restrictions imposed by the underlying SPM
     instruction that is used to program the device from inside the
     boot loader.  Note that programming the boot lock bits can result
     in a "shoot-into-your-foot" scenario as the only way to unprogram
     these bits is a chip erase, which will also erase the boot loader
     code.

     The boot loader implements the "chip erase" function by erasing the
     flash pages of the application section.

     Reading fuse and lock bits is fully supported.

     Note that due to the inability to write the fuse bits, the safemode
     functionality does not make sense for these boot loaders.

   Ensure the correct socket and routing card are mounted _before_
powering on the STK600.  While the STK600 firmware ensures the socket
and routing card mounted match each other (using a table stored
internally in nonvolatile memory), it cannot handle the case where a
wrong routing card is used, e. g. the routing card `STK600-RC040M-5'
(which is meant for 40-pin DIP AVRs that have an ADC, with the power
supply pins in the center of the package) was used but an ATmega8515
inserted (which uses the "industry standard" pinout with Vcc and GND at
opposite corners).

   Note that for devices that use the routing card `STK600-RC008T-2',
in order to use ISP mode, the jumper for `AREF0' must be removed as it
would otherwise block one of the ISP signals.  High-voltage serial
programming can be used even with that jumper installed.

   The ISP system of the STK600 contains a detection against shortcuts
and other wiring errors.  AVRDUDE initiates a connection check before
trying to enter ISP programming mode, and display the result if the
target is not found ready to be ISP programmed.

   High-voltage programming requires the target voltage to be set to at
least 4.5 V in order to work.  This can be done using _Terminal Mode_,
see *Note Terminal Mode Operation::.

5.2 Atmel DFU bootloader using FLIP version 1
=============================================

Bootloaders using the FLIP protocol version 1 experience some very
specific behaviour.

   These bootloaders have no option to access memory areas other than
Flash and EEPROM.

   When the bootloader is started, it enters a _security mode_ where
the only acceptable access is to query the device configuration
parameters (which are used for the signature on AVR devices).  The only
way to leave this mode is a _chip erase_.  As a chip erase is normally
implied by the `-U' option when reprogramming the flash, this
peculiarity might not be very obvious immediately.

   Sometimes, a bootloader with security mode already disabled seems to
no longer respond with sensible configuration data, but only 0xFF for
all queries.  As these queries are used to obtain the equivalent of a
signature, AVRDUDE can only continue in that situation by forcing the
signature check to be overridden with the `-F' option.

   A _chip erase_ might leave the EEPROM unerased, at least on some
versions of the bootloader.

A.1.1 Unix Installation
-----------------------

To build and install from the source tarball on Unix like systems:

     $ gunzip -c avrdude-6.3.tar.gz | tar xf -
     $ cd avrdude-6.3
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ su root -c 'make install'

   The default location of the install is into `/usr/local' so you will
need to be sure that `/usr/local/bin' is in your `PATH' environment
variable.

   If you do not have root access to your system, you can do the
following instead:

     $ gunzip -c avrdude-6.3.tar.gz | tar xf -
     $ cd avrdude-6.3
     $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local

A.1.1.1 FreeBSD Installation
............................

AVRDUDE is installed via the FreeBSD Ports Tree as follows:

     % su - root
     # cd /usr/ports/devel/avrdude
     # make install

   If you wish to install from a pre-built package instead of the
source, you can use the following instead:

     % su - root
     # pkg_add -r avrdude

   Of course, you must be connected to the Internet for these methods to
work, since that is where the source as well as the pre-built package is
obtained.

A.1.2 Unix Configuration Files
------------------------------

When AVRDUDE is build using the default `--prefix' configure option,
the default configuration file for a Unix system is located at
`/usr/local/etc/avrdude.conf'.  This can be overridden by using the
`-C' command line option.  Additionally, the user's home directory is
searched for a file named `.avrduderc', and if found, is used to
augment the system default configuration file.

A.1.3 Unix Port Names
---------------------

The parallel and serial port device file names are system specific.
The following table lists the default names for a given system.

*System*               *Default Parallel      *Default Serial Port*
                       Port*                  
FreeBSD                `/dev/ppi0'            `/dev/cuad0'
Linux                  `/dev/parport0'        `/dev/ttyS0'
Solaris                `/dev/printers/0'      `/dev/term/a'

   On FreeBSD systems, AVRDUDE uses the ppi(4) interface for accessing
the parallel port and the sio(4) driver for serial port access.

   On Linux systems, AVRDUDE uses the ppdev interface for accessing the
parallel port and the tty driver for serial port access.

   On Solaris systems, AVRDUDE uses the ecpp(7D) driver for accessing
the parallel port and the asy(7D) driver for serial port access.

A.2.1 Installation
------------------

A Windows executable of avrdude is included in WinAVR which can be
found at `http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr'. WinAVR is a suite of
executable, open source software development tools for the AVR for the
Windows platform.

   There are two options to build avrdude from source under Windows.
The first one is to use Cygwin (`http://www.cygwin.com/').

   To build and install from the source tarball for Windows (using
Cygwin):

     $ set PREFIX=<your install directory path>
     $ export PREFIX
     $ gunzip -c avrdude-6.3.tar.gz | tar xf -
     $ cd avrdude-6.3
     $ ./configure LDFLAGS="-static" --prefix=$PREFIX --datadir=$PREFIX
     --sysconfdir=$PREFIX/bin --enable-versioned-doc=no
     $ make
     $ make install

   Note that recent versions of Cygwin (starting with 1.7) removed the
MinGW support from the compiler that is needed in order to build a
native Win32 API binary that does not require to install the Cygwin
library `cygwin1.dll' at run-time.  Either try using an older compiler
version that still supports MinGW builds, or use MinGW
(`http://www.mingw.org/') directly.

A.2.2.2 How AVRDUDE finds the configuration files.
..................................................

AVRDUDE on Windows has a different way of searching for the system and
user configuration files. Below is the search method for locating the
configuration files:

  1. The directory from which the application loaded.

  2. The current directory.

  3. The Windows system directory. On Windows NT, the name of this
     directory is `SYSTEM32'.

  4. Windows NT: The 16-bit Windows system directory. The name of this
     directory is `SYSTEM'.

  5. The Windows directory.

  6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.

File: avrdude.info,  Node: Parallel Ports,  Prev: Serial Ports,  Up: Windows Port Names

A.2.3.2 Parallel Ports
......................

AVRDUDE will accept 3 Windows parallel port names: lpt1, lpt2, or lpt3.
Each of these names corresponds to a fixed parallel port base address:

`lpt1'
     0x378

`lpt2'
     0x278

`lpt3'
     0x3BC


   On your desktop PC, lpt1 will be the most common choice. If you are
using a laptop, you might have to use lpt3 instead of lpt1. Select the
name of the port the corresponds to the base address of the parallel
port that you want.

   If the parallel port can be accessed through a different address,
this address can be specified directly, using the common C language
notation (i. e., hexadecimal values are prefixed by `0x').

A.2.4.1 Windows NT/2K/XP
........................

On Windows NT, 2000, and XP user applications cannot directly access the
parallel port. However, kernel mode drivers can access the parallel
port.  giveio.sys is a driver that can allow user applications to set
the state of the parallel port pins.

   Before using AVRDUDE, the giveio.sys driver must be loaded. The
accompanying command-line program, loaddrv.exe, can do just that.

   To make things even easier there are 3 batch files that are also
included:

  1. install_giveio.bat Install and start the giveio driver.

  2. status_giveio.bat Check on the status of the giveio driver.

  3. remove_giveio.bat Stop and remove the giveio driver from memory.

   These 3 batch files calls the loaddrv program with various options to
install, start, stop, and remove the driver.

   When you first execute install_giveio.bat, loaddrv.exe and giveio.sys
must be in the current directory. When install_giveio.bat is executed it
will copy giveio.sys from your current directory to your Windows
directory. It will then load the driver from the Windows directory. This
means that after the first time install_giveio is executed, you should
be able to subsequently execute the batch file from any directory and
have it successfully start the driver.

   Note that you must have administrator privilege to load the giveio
driver.

Appendix B Troubleshooting
**************************

In general, please report any bugs encountered via
`http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=avrdude'.

   * Problem: I'm using a serial programmer under Windows and get the
     following error:

     `avrdude: serial_open(): can't set attributes for device "com1"',

     Solution: This problem seems to appear with certain versions of
     Cygwin. Specifying `"/dev/com1"' instead of `"com1"' should help.

   * Problem: I'm using Linux and my AVR910 programmer is really slow.

     Solution (short): `setserial PORT low_latency'

     Solution (long): There are two problems here. First, the system
     may wait some time before it passes data from the serial port to
     the program. Under Linux the following command works around this
     (you may need root privileges for this).

     `setserial PORT low_latency'

     Secondly, the serial interface chip may delay the interrupt for
     some time.  This behaviour can be changed by setting the
     FIFO-threshold to one. Under Linux this can only be done by
     changing the kernel source in `drivers/char/serial.c'.  Search the
     file for `UART_FCR_TRIGGER_8' and replace it with
     `UART_FCR_TRIGGER_1'. Note that overall performance might suffer
     if there is high throughput on serial lines. Also note that you
     are modifying the kernel at your own risk.

   * Problem: I'm not using Linux and my AVR910 programmer is really
     slow.

     Solutions: The reasons for this are the same as above.  If you
     know how to work around this on your OS, please let us know.

   * Problem: Updating the flash ROM from terminal mode does not work
     with the JTAG ICEs.

     Solution: None at this time.  Currently, the JTAG ICE code cannot
     write to the flash ROM one byte at a time.

   * Problem: Page-mode programming the EEPROM (using the -U option)
     does not erase EEPROM cells before writing, and thus cannot
     overwrite any previous value != 0xff.

     Solution: None.  This is an inherent feature of the way JTAG EEPROM
     programming works, and is documented that way in the Atmel AVR
     datasheets.  In order to successfully program the EEPROM that way,
     a prior chip erase (with the EESAVE fuse unprogrammed) is required.
     This also applies to the STK500 and STK600 in high-voltage
     programming mode.

   * Problem: How do I turn off the DWEN fuse?

     Solution: If the DWEN (debugWire enable) fuse is activated, the
     /RESET pin is not functional anymore, so normal ISP communication
     cannot be established.  There are two options to deactivate that
     fuse again: high-voltage programming, or getting the JTAG ICE mkII
     talk debugWire, and prepare the target AVR to accept normal ISP
     communication again.

     The first option requires a programmer that is capable of
     high-voltage programming (either serial or parallel, depending on
     the AVR device), for example the STK500.  In high-voltage
     programming mode, the /RESET pin is activated initially using a 12
     V pulse (thus the name _high voltage_), so the target AVR can
     subsequently be reprogrammed, and the DWEN fuse can be cleared.
     Typically, this operation cannot be performed while the AVR is
     located in the target circuit though.

     The second option requires a JTAG ICE mkII that can talk the
     debugWire protocol.  The ICE needs to be connected to the target
     using the JTAG-to-ISP adapter, so the JTAG ICE mkII can be used as
     a debugWire initiator as well as an ISP programmer.  AVRDUDE will
     then be activated using the JTAG2ISP programmer type.  The initial
     ISP communication attempt will fail, but AVRDUDE then tries to
     initiate a debugWire reset.  When successful, this will leave the
     target AVR in a state where it can accept standard ISP
     communication.  The ICE is then signed off (which will make it
     signing off from the USB as well), so AVRDUDE has to be called
     again afterwards.  This time, standard ISP communication can work,
     so the DWEN fuse can be cleared.

     The pin mapping for the JTAG-to-ISP adapter is:

     *JTAG pin*    *ISP pin*
     1             3
     2             6
     3             1
     4             2
     6             5
     9             4

   * Problem: Multiple USBasp or USBtinyISP programmers connected
     simultaneously are not found.

     Solution: The USBtinyISP code supports distinguishing multiple
     programmers based on their bus:device connection tuple that
     describes their place in the USB hierarchy on a specific host.
     This tuple can be added to the -P USB option, similar to adding a
     serial number on other USB-based programmers.

     The actual naming convention for the bus and device names is
     operating-system dependent; AVRDUDE will print out what it found
     on the bus when running it with (at least) one -V option.  By
     specifying a string that cannot match any existing device (for
     example, -P USB:XXX), the scan will list all possible candidate
     devices found on the bus.

     Examples:
          avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega8 -P usb:003:025 (Linux)
          avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega8 -P usb:/dev/usb:/dev/ugen1.3 (FreeBSD 8+)
          avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega8 \
            -P usb:bus-0:\\.\libusb0-0001--0x1781-0x0c9f (Windows)

   * Problem: I cannot do ... when the target is in debugWire mode.

     Solution: debugWire mode imposes several limitations.

     The debugWire protocol is Atmel's proprietary one-wire (plus
     ground) protocol to allow an in-circuit emulation of the smaller
     AVR devices, using the /RESET line.  DebugWire mode is initiated
     by activating the DWEN fuse, and then power-cycling the target.
     While this mode is mainly intended for debugging/emulation, it
     also offers limited programming capabilities.  Effectively, the
     only memory areas that can be read or programmed in this mode are
     flash ROM and EEPROM.  It is also possible to read out the
     signature.  All other memory areas cannot be accessed.  There is no
     _chip erase_ functionality in debugWire mode; instead, while
     reprogramming the flash ROM, each flash ROM page is erased right
     before updating it.  This is done transparently by the JTAG ICE
     mkII (or AVR Dragon).  The only way back from debugWire mode is to
     initiate a special sequence of commands to the JTAG ICE mkII (or
     AVR Dragon), so the debugWire mode will be temporarily disabled,
     and the target can be accessed using normal ISP programming.  This
     sequence is automatically initiated by using the JTAG ICE mkII or
     AVR Dragon in ISP mode, when they detect that ISP mode cannot be
     entered.

   * Problem: I want to use my JTAG ICE mkII to program an Xmega device
     through PDI.  The documentation tells me to use the _XMEGA PDI
     adapter for JTAGICE mkII_ that is supposed to ship with the kit,
     yet I don't have it.

     Solution: Use the following pin mapping:

     *JTAGICE*     *Target*      *Squid cab-*  *PDI*
     *mkII probe*  *pins*        *le colors*   *header*
     1 (TCK)                     Black         
     2 (GND)       GND           White         6
     3 (TDO)                     Grey          
     4 (VTref)     VTref         Purple        2
     5 (TMS)                     Blue          
     6 (nSRST)     PDI_CLK       Green         5
     7 (N.C.)                    Yellow        
     8 (nTRST)                   Orange        
     9 (TDI)       PDI_DATA      Red           1
     10 (GND)                    Brown         

   * Problem: I want to use my AVR Dragon to program an Xmega device
     through PDI.

     Solution: Use the 6 pin ISP header on the Dragon and the following
     pin mapping:

     *Dragon*      *Target*
     *ISP Header*  *pins*
     1 (MISO)      PDI_DATA
     2 (VCC)       VCC
     3 (SCK)       
     4 (MOSI)      
     5 (RESET)     PDI_CLK / RST
     6 (GND)       GND

   * Problem: I want to use my AVRISP mkII to program an ATtiny4/5/9/10
     device through TPI.  How to connect the pins?

     Solution: Use the following pin mapping:

     *AVRISP*      *Target*      *ATtiny*
     *connector*   *pins*        *pin #*
     1 (MISO)      TPIDATA       1
     2 (VTref)     Vcc           5
     3 (SCK)       TPICLK        3
     4 (MOSI)                    
     5 (RESET)     /RESET        6
     6 (GND)       GND           2

   * Problem: I want to program an ATtiny4/5/9/10 device using a
     serial/parallel bitbang programmer.  How to connect the pins?

     Solution: Since TPI has only 1 pin for bi-directional data
     transfer, both MISO and MOSI pins should be connected to the
     TPIDATA pin on the ATtiny device.  However, a 1K resistor should
     be placed between the MOSI and TPIDATA.  The MISO pin connects to
     TPIDATA directly.  The SCK pin is connected to TPICLK.

     In addition, the VCC, /RESET and GND pins should be connected to
     their respective ports on the ATtiny device.

   * Problem: How can I use a FTDI FT232R USB-to-Serial device for
     bitbang programming?

     Solution: When connecting the FT232 directly to the pins of the
     target Atmel device, the polarity of the pins defined in the
     `programmer' definition should be inverted by prefixing a tilde.
     For example, the DASA programmer would look like this when
     connected via a FT232R device (notice the tildes in front of pins
     7, 4, 3 and 8):

          programmer
            id    = "dasa_ftdi";
            desc  = "serial port banging, reset=rts sck=dtr mosi=txd miso=cts";
            type  = serbb;
            reset = ~7;
            sck   = ~4;
            mosi  = ~3;
            miso  = ~8;
          ;

     Note that this uses the FT232 device as a normal serial port, not
     using the FTDI drivers in the special bitbang mode.

   * Problem: My ATtiny4/5/9/10 reads out fine, but any attempt to
     program it (through TPI) fails.  Instead, the memory retains the
     old contents.

     Solution: Mind the limited programming supply voltage range of
     these devices.

     In-circuit programming through TPI is only guaranteed by the
     datasheet at Vcc = 5 V.

   * Problem: My ATxmega...A1/A2/A3 cannot be programmed through PDI
     with my AVR Dragon.  Programming through a JTAG ICE mkII works
     though, as does programming through JTAG.

     Solution: None by this time (2010 Q1).

     It is said that the AVR Dragon can only program devices from the A4
     Xmega sub-family.

   * Problem: when programming with an AVRISPmkII or STK600, AVRDUDE
     hangs when programming files of a certain size (e.g. 246 bytes).
     Other (larger or smaller) sizes work though.

     Solution: This is a bug caused by an incorrect handling of
     zero-length packets (ZLPs) in some versions of the libusb 0.1 API
     wrapper that ships with libusb 1.x in certain Linux distributions.
     All Linux systems with kernel versions < 2.6.31 and libusb >=
     1.0.0 < 1.0.3 are reported to be affected by this.

     See also: `http://www.libusb.org/ticket/6'

   * Problem: after flashing a firmware that reduces the target's clock
     speed (e.g. through the `CLKPR' register), further ISP connection
     attempts fail.

     Solution: Even though ISP starts with pulling /RESET low, the
     target continues to run at the internal clock speed as defined by
     the firmware running before.  Therefore, the ISP clock speed must
     be reduced appropriately (to less than 1/4 of the internal clock
     speed) using the -B option before the ISP initialization sequence
     will succeed.

     As that slows down the entire subsequent ISP session, it might make
     sense to just issue a _chip erase_ using the slow ISP clock
     (option `-e'), and then start a new session at higher speed.
     Option `-D' might be used there, to prevent another unneeded erase
     cycle.
